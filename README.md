📰 Fake News Detector using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Fake News Detection System built using Machine Learning techniques. The model classifies news articles as either:

✅ Real News

❌ Fake News

The main objective of this project is to prevent the spread of misinformation by detecting fake content in news datasets.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains labeled news articles with columns like title, text, and label.

Label 1 → Real News

Label 0 → Fake News
